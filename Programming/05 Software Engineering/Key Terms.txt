The bit of code that was working but is now broken is called a "regression".

Debugging - the process of finding the source of an error.

Rubber Duck Debugging - debugging by describing what is happening to your code to a rubber duck.

Profiling - the process of fixing performance issues in code. Typically done using a tool (a profiler) to show you the runtime, 
memory usage, or details about your program
