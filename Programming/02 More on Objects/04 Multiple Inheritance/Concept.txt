Multiple Inheritance:
    When one class inherits from multiple classes directly.
    What it is not:
        When a class has a superclass and then that super class has a super class.
        This is still single inheritance, just multiple classes with single inheritance

    Not every language that supports OOP supports multiple inheritance. Python does.
