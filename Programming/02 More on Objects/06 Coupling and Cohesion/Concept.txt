Coupling and Cohesion

A unit is any reasonable self-contained component
    Ex: a function, a class, a file, a set of files in a folder

Coupling:
    - The linking of two separate units
    - Goal is loosely coupled units (not dependent on each other)
    - Tightly coupled units are generally considered bad practice

Cohesion:
    - refers to the "number" of AND diversity of tasks that signle unit does
    - High Cohesion means a unit is only responsible for 1 single task
    - Low Cohesion means it is responsible for many tasks
